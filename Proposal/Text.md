# Support for Security Advisory Data Scientist for Ruby Community

## Scope
   - Focus on becoming a first class citizen in the software security advisory community.
   - Only existing/known/legacy vulnerabilities (brand new  ones are covered by project' "security policies")
   - Mostly Remote work based
  
* Examples of Activiites Involved

   A. Apply for new CVEs for existing non-CVE advisories.
      - Example:
        - xRAD's OSDVB adversaries (62 files)
        - RAD#487: s/OSVDB/CVE/
        - RAD#228: Ruby-lang (iss => CVE => ADV)
        - RAD#350: "patched_versions for rubyzip CVE-2018-1000544.yml"
        - RAD#289: "guard-livereload security vulnerability"
        - RAD#272: "Add advisory for will_paginate"
        - RAD#377: "Add advisory for intercom-rails"

   B. Create advisories for exisiting CVEs into existing databases such as RAD, <TBD>.
      - Output of "A." activities
      - RAD#238: Got-CVE-Need-Advisory (BACKLOG)

   C. Encourage OSV-SCHEMA(#123) to include more than Rubygem advisories
      - Such as "rubies" (Ruby languages)
      - Example: "Unreviewed" GHSA Advisories (??)
        - Example: https://github.com/ossf/osv-schema/issues/123

   D. Add additional known data to existing advisories.
      - Example: GH/jasnow's 11 GHSA PRs
