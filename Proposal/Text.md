# Proposal: Position: Security Advisory Data Scientist for Ruby Community

Mr. X,

I propose that the "Ruby Shield" program create a 
"Security Advisory Data Scientist for Ruby Community" who focuses on
legacy Ruby-related advisories.

I have created a draft outline to suggest what the scope might be.

For the last few months, I have been helping out on several
advisory projects and have learned about this niche.

Feel free to contact me to discuss and help on this proposal.

Thanks,
Me

## Scope
 - Focus on becoming a first class citizen in the software security advisory community.
 - Only existing/known/legacy vulnerabilities (brand new ones are covered by project's "security policies")
 - Remote work based except for Ruby-related events
  
# Examples of Activities Involved

A. Apply for new CVEs for existing non-CVE advisories.
   - Example:
     - RAD's OSDVB adversaries (62 files)
     - RAD#487: s/OSVDB/CVE/
     - RAD#289: "guard-livereload security vulnerability"
     - RAD#272: "Add advisory for will_paginate"
     - RAD#377: "Add advisory for intercom-rails"
     - ~~RAD#228: Ruby-lang (iss => CVE => ADV)~~
     - ~~RAD#350: "patched_versions for rubyzip CVE-2018-1000544.yml"~~

B. Create advisories for existing CVEs without advisories. Then to add them to an advisory database.
   - Output of "A." activities
   - RAD#238: Got-CVE-Need-Advisory (BACKLOG)

C. Encourage OSV-SCHEMA project (#123) to include more than Rubygem advisories.
   - Such as "rubies" (Ruby languages)
   - Example: "Unreviewed" GHSA Advisories
     - Example: ~~https://github.com/ossf/osv-schema/issues/123~~

D. Add additional known data to existing advisories.
   - Example: ~~GH/jasnow's 11 GHSA PRs~~

E. Organize special events for Advisory-related improvements.
   - ~~Participate in RailsConf/2023~~
   - Participate in "AppDev" village at Defcon/2023
   - Participate in 2023 Octotofest (month long event)
   - Participate in 2023 24pullrequests (24 PRs in 24 days in December
   - Participate in RubyConf/2023
   - Google Summer of Code (2024)
   - Ruby Community "Adversary Hack" Days
   - Run advisory training sessions at conferences.

F. HUB: Create central location for "Ruby Community" Advisory Information.

G. Create/support tools/databases to support above advisory activities.
   - ~~GSD-related tools (RAD-to-GSD importer)~~
   - ~~RAD/SYNC2~~

H. Follow the Forks (maybe not just the Rubygem.org's link repo)
   - "DOESGEMEXIST" check

I. Conduct research in how to deal with dead links inside advisories.

R. Collecting Stats/Reporting
   - RAD (ruby-advisory-db)
   - GHSA (GitHub Security Advisories)
   - GSD (Global Security Database)

...................................................................

Y. Research other data sources than RAD/GHSA.
   - GSD
   - NVD Feed
   - SUSE Feed

Z. Get Paid.
